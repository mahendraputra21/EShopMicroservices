# Proxy Pattern
The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 
In your case, CachedBasketRepository acts as a proxy to BasketRepository. It controls access by adding caching functionality:
    1. Control Access: It first checks if the basket is in the cache before fetching it from the repository.
    2. Caching: If the basket is not in the cache, it retrieves it from the underlying BasketRepository and then stores it in the cache.

# Decorator Pattern
The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. 
Here, CachedBasketRepository extends the functionality of BasketRepository without modifying it directly:

    1. Enhancement: CachedBasketRepository enhances BasketRepository by adding caching capabilities.
    2. Delegation: It delegates the actual data operations (like fetching, storing, and deleting baskets) 
       to the BasketRepository while adding additional behavior (like caching).

Implementation
Here's how it works:

1. Dependency Injection:

```
builder.Services.AddScoped<IBasketRepository, BasketRepository>();
builder.Services.Decorate<IBasketRepository, CachedBasketRepository>();
```

*) The first line registers BasketRepository as the implementation for IBasketRepository.
*) The second line decorates IBasketRepository with CachedBasketRepository, 
   meaning whenever IBasketRepository is requested, an instance of CachedBasketRepository is provided, which wraps BasketRepository.

2. CachedBasketRepository Implementation:
 *) It holds a reference to both the actual BasketRepository (proxied object) and a cache.
 *) It implements the same interface (IBasketRepository), ensuring it can be used interchangeably.
 *) Methods like GetBasket, StoreBasket, and DeleteBasket first perform caching logic before delegating the actual operations to BasketRepository.

 Conclusion
 By combining the Proxy and Decorator patterns, you achieve a flexible and reusable design where 
 CachedBasketRepository can add caching functionality to any implementation of 
 IBasketRepository without modifying the original repository code.
